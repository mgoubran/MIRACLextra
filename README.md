# MIRACLextra

This is extra atlas data for [MIRACLdev](https://www.github.com/vsoch/MIRACLdev),
the idea being that we install the data into the container built from there.
Original files were obtained from [Stanford Medicine Box](https://stanfordmedicine.app.box.com/s/6kx5tfgbqd6ruk7uo0u64agn4oqpg39i/folder/39488920550)
from the atlases/ara folder. All but one of the templates `average_template_10um.nii.gz`
that was over the 100MB limit we are able to serve from GitHub.

The input data (and other dependencies served from that Medicine Box) were
too large to be shared here.
